# Calculator (Basic-programming-Project)

I developed this project that is a calculator in the console environment, as a university project.
It is able to calculate n-digit to n-digit numbers operation.
Operations like:
- summation
- subtraction
- division
- multiplication
- sine 
- cosine 
- tangent
- cotangent
- logarithm
- Power etc.

It can also calculate expressions containing the desired number of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations with numbers with desired digits.


## How to use:

- When you run the project in Visual Studio, this console screen will appear and you can choose the operation you want:

- For example i choose the Cosine operation and I enter the input p=3.14, which should give us the answer "-1" (Note that the input must be in radians):

- In another example, we will try the Ln function, which should receive the answer "1" with the input e=2.71828, which is the Neper number:

- Now, if you choose item 0, you can calculate a mathematical expression that is a combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division:

- And we see that the entered mathematical expression is answered correctly.
